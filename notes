Mutations are responsible for single state changes
  - ie. update products array in our store
  - setProducts (state, products) {
      state.products = products
  }
Getters function the same way as computed properties
  - good for filtering or calculating during runtime
  - ie. calculate shopping cart total
  - availableProducts (state, getters) {
      return state.products.filter(product => product.inventory > 0)
  }
